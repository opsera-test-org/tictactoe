  "user_message": "Forge pre-commit checklist must be completed before committing.",
  "agent_message": "FORGE PRE-COMMIT CHECKLIST — You must complete ALL steps below before the commit can proceed.\n\n## Step 1 — Unit Tests\n1. Run `git diff --cached --name-only` to get the list of staged files.\n2. For each staged source file, determine whether a corresponding unit test file exists (e.g., `foo.ts` → `foo.test.ts` or `foo.spec.ts`).\n3. If a test file is MISSING, auto-generate a unit test file for it.\n4. Run the full test suite for all affected test files.\n5. If any test FAILS:\n   a. Attempt to auto-fix the test.\n   b. If the fix requires changes to business/production logic (not just test code), you MUST ask the user for consent before making the change.\n   c. Re-run the tests to confirm they pass.\n\n## Step 2 — Acceptance Criteria Validation\n1. Use the Forge MCP `get_work_order` tool to retrieve the current work order.\n2. Read the `acceptance_criteria` field from the task.\n3. Review every acceptance criterion against the staged changes.\n4. If any criterion is NOT satisfied, inform the user and ask how to proceed.\n\n## Step 3 — Security Scan (Conditional)\n1. Check whether the `lineaje-unifAI` MCP server is available (try listing its tools).\n2. If it IS available:\n   a. Get the staged diff with `git diff --cached`.\n   b. Call the `lineaje_aiepo_security_workflow` tool with the diff content.\n   c. If the scan reports issues, follow the remediation instructions provided by Lineaje to fix them, then re-stage the fixes.\n   d. If the scan passes, proceed.\n3. If it is NOT available, note 'Security scan skipped — Lineaje MCP not configured' and proceed.\n\n## Step 4 — Report to Forge\nUse the Forge MCP `update_work_order` tool to update the work order with:\n- `work_order_id`: the current work order ID\n- `commit_summary`: a brief description of the changes being committed\n- `test_summary`: summary of test execution (how many tests ran, passed, failed, auto-generated)\n- `security_scan_summary`: result of the Lineaje scan, or 'skipped' if not configured\n\nYou MUST also include these structured fields for activity tracking:\n- `repo_url`: the remote origin URL (run `git remote get-url origin`)\n- `repo_name`: owner/repo extracted from the URL\n- `branch_name`: current branch (run `git branch --show-current`)\n- `commit_hash`: the full SHA of the commit being made (use `git rev-parse HEAD` after committing, or the staged commit SHA)\n- `commit_message`: the commit message text\n- `commit_author`: author name (run `git config user.name`)\n- `files_changed`: number of files changed (from `git diff --cached --stat`)\n- `lines_added`: total lines added\n- `lines_removed`: total lines removed\n- `changed_files`: array of objects with `path`, `additions`, and `deletions` per file (from `git diff --cached --numstat`)\n- `tests_total`: total number of tests run\n- `tests_passed`: number of tests that passed\n- `tests_failed`: number of tests that failed\n- `tests_skipped`: number of tests skipped (0 if none)\n- `test_coverage`: code coverage percentage if available (0-100), omit if not available\n\n## Step 5 — Mark Ready\nAfter ALL steps above are complete, create a file called `.forge-commit-ready` in the project root (write the text 'ready' to it), then retry the exact same `git commit` command."
